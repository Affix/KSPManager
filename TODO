This TODO list is for tracking feature ideas that come up but are not the current priority.


- make ship and part inventory tabs work
- part information
- kerbel.net integration cleanup, beautification
- make sure manual file additions and deletions thru Finder are automatically noticed
- add badges to tabs to indicate items added from zip/dir/pkg 
- modal dialog showing manifest of items discovered to augment badges
- downloads on seperate operations queue to free up main thread
- download progress meter ( kerbal.net needs to publish zip file size )

- ship inventory part count
- ship inventory fuel / isp per stage / total mass / % mass per stage / deltaV per stage
- add licensing info to source files
- preferences pane
- menu bar options
- action menus when right clicking on stuff
- action menus when clicking action buttons
- more tool tips
- keep dates for freshness checking
- .craft -> JSON -> .craft filter
- .sfs -> JSON -> .sfs filter
- part.cfg -> JSON -> part.cfg filter

Version 2
- re-write using FileWrappers
- re-write Assets and KSP objects to manage Manifests, first write Manifests
- perferences window
- add-on optimization driven by ship composition (install only the parts required for a ship or set or ships )
- instant orbit assistant
- savefile editing and versioning
- part editor modal dialog thingy
- ship editor "
- crew editor "

Nice To Have, Not Holding My Breath
- .mu access for part thumbnails
- ship thumbnails would be awesome
- scrub out SymArm, cats out of the bag.
- undo/redo manager

BUG


DONE
- clean out cached unzipped distributions
- plist UnityGraphicsQuality combo-box or something
- go to '~/Library/Preferences/unity.Squad.Kerbal Space Program.plist', go into Root and add a child called 'UnityGraphicsQuality' and set its class to 'number' and set the value to 3.
- Internals and Props need to be unpacked and managed. Dang it.
- kerbal.net download path is wrong ( download is being appended to the zip file name instead of being a directory )

GOOD Idea, Not Gonna Do It For V1
- video demonstrating usage
- refactor Asset -> Addon?  semantics
- user ship ratings ( give ships stars! )
- rewrite persistent.sfs object heirarchy, try to share with Asset
- look into kspmm://
- automated addon refresh from kerbel.net, some or all

Not Gonna Do It
- change color scheme away from grey, grey on light blue? black bg?
- build full blown NSDocument? fragile, will break the minute Squad changes something
