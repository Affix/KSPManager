This TODO list is for tracking feature ideas/snafus

- make ship and part inventory tabs work
- part information
- make sure manual file additions and deletions thru Finder are automatically noticed
- ship inventory part count
- ship inventory fuel / isp per stage / total mass / % mass per stage / deltaV per stage
- add licensing info to source files
- preferences pane
- action menus when right clicking on stuff
- action menus when clicking action buttons
- more tool tips
- utility: change values of CONIC_PATCH_LIMIT in settings.cfg
- part name changer to organize parts in the VAB/SPH tabs for each category


Fix For .17
- Ship heirarchy is weird now
-   one big pot of available ships, seperate VAB, SPH and Sandbox (VAB|SPH) destinations ugh
- fix Crew tab
- Plugins directory was missing in stock distribution.. weird
- Screenshot directory was missing in stock distribution, no bigs



Version 2
- re-write using FileWrappers ( managed by Manifests )
- re-write Assets and KSP objects to manage Manifests, first write Manifests
- perferences window
- add-on optimization driven by ship composition (install only the parts required for a ship or set or ships )
- savefile editing and versioning
- mission editor
-   instant orbit assistant
- part editor
- ship editor
- crew editor

Nice To Have, Not Holding My Breath
- .mu access for part thumbnails
- ship thumbnails would be awesome
- scrub out SymArm, cats out of the bag.
- undo/redo manager
- modal dialog showing manifest of items discovered to augment badges
- add badges to tabs to indicate items added from zip/dir/pkg 
- download progress meter ( kerbal.net needs to publish zip file size )


BUG


DONE
- clean out cached unzipped distributions
- plist UnityGraphicsQuality combo-box or something
- go to '~/Library/Preferences/unity.Squad.Kerbal Space Program.plist', go into Root and add a child called 'UnityGraphicsQuality' and set its class to 'number' and set the value to 3.
- Internals and Props need to be unpacked and managed. Dang it.
- kerbal.net download path is wrong ( download is being appended to the zip file name instead of being a directory )
- kerbel.net integration cleanup, beautification
- downloads on seperate operations queue to free up main thread
- change from "Mod" subdirectory within KSP ROOT to "Managed"
- migrate process for "Mod" to "Managed" change

GOOD Idea, Not Gonna Do It For V1
- video demonstrating usage
- refactor Asset -> Addon?  semantics
- user ship ratings ( give ships stars! )
- rewrite persistent.sfs object heirarchy, try to share with Asset
- look into kspmm://, it's a centralized redirector
- automated addon refresh from kerbel.net, some or all
- .craft -> JSON -> .craft filter
- .sfs -> JSON -> .sfs filter
- part.cfg -> JSON -> part.cfg filter
- keep dates for freshness checking, possible but dont want to deal with it


Not Gonna Do It
- change color scheme away from grey, grey on light blue? black bg? - actually ...
- build full blown NSDocument? fragile, will break the minute Squad changes something
